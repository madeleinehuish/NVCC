# NVCC


**About:**
>This is a small youtube video app built in React.js with a Brunch build and server. Acknowledgment and thanks to Stephen Grider for part of the code base. I reconfigured some things to make the app more in line with how I work with React.

**Live Site:**
[Video App](https://madeleinehuishvideoapp.herokuapp.com/)

**Instructions for downloading:**

> Clone from repository and run npm install from the command line. Then type 'npm start' to start up the server. Go to localhost:8000 in the browser to see the site.
