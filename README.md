# Nventi Video Coding Challenge


**About:**
>This is a small youtube video app built in React.js with a Brunch build and server. Acknowledgment and thanks to Stephen Grider for part of the code base. I reconfigured some things to make the app more in line with how I work with React.

**Live Site:**
